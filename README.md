# Road-Accident-Dashboard-Using-Advance-Excel
I created a Road Accident Analytics Dashboard in Excel to analyze and visualize accident data from 2021 and 2022. It provides insights into patterns like location, time, and severity, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions and improve road safety through targeted interventions.


# Skills showcased in this Project
* Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Analysis
* Filtering, Sorting and Conditional function.
* Pivot Tables and Pivot Chart
* Data Visulisation and Dashboard creation


# Requirements and KPIs
Clients want to create a road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on following aspects-

* Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth
* Primary KPI's-Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth
* Secondary KPIs - Total Casualties concerning vehicle type for the Current Year
* Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year
* Casualties by Road Type for the Current Year
* Current Year Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/Night
* Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location


# Data Cleaning and Transformation
This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.

* Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors
* Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
* Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
* Creating 2 new attributes 'Year' and 'Month' were added for logical and easy interpretation of dataset.


# Data Analysis
I developed a "Data Analysis" sheet to streamline the understanding of pivot table data, making it user-friendly for new users, developers, or clients. This sheet features nine pivot tables, designed to summarize the data and uncover key trends, such as the relationship between the number of casualties and various factors like casualty type, vehicle type, road type, and location. Monthly patterns for 2021 and 2022 were also meticulously analyzed, providing a deeper insight into accident trends. This approach simplifies data interpretation and enhances decision-making by focusing on critical areas of concern.

Below is a snippet of the Data Analysis Sheet

# Data Visualization
Finally, the dashboard was crafted by integrating and customizing pivot charts linked to their respective pivot tables. To ensure a user-friendly and interactive experience, slicers and timelines were seamlessly incorporated, allowing for dynamic filtering of data. Hyperlinks and intuitive connections were added to essential icons, offering smooth and effortless navigation throughout the dashboard, elevating both functionality and user engagement.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.

# Key Insights

üìà Total Casualties Analysis: The dashboard reveals that a staggering 417,883 casualties occurred after accidents during the two-year period

üìÖ Peak Months: Overall the number of casulaties were slightly higher in 2021 than 2022. Maximum Casualties happened in the month of October and November in both the Years and minimum casualties take place in the month of January and February.

üöó Casualties by Vehicle Type: Car accidents accounted for the highest number of casualties, contributing to 79.8% of the total. On the other hand, casualties were minimal in accidents involving other vehicle types.

ü©∏ Casualties by accident severity Slight severity form the bulk of casualties 84.1% whereas there are only 1.7% Fatal severity casualties.

üõ£Ô∏è Road Type Analysis: Maximum Casualties by Single Carriageway road type (310.1K) and Minimum by Slip road(5.1K)

üåßÔ∏è Casualties Distribution by Road Surface: Highest Distribution of total casualties on Dry road surfaces (67%)

üèôÔ∏è Casualties Relation by Area/Location Urban areas form the majority of casualties after an accident (61%)

‚òÄÔ∏è Casualties Distribution by light condtion: 73% of casulties take place in daylight condtion


# Recommendations based on the Analysis

* Critical High-Risk Periods: The dashboard highlights October and November as the most dangerous months, urging traffic police and stakeholders to intensify road safety measures during these times.
* Targeted Awareness for Car Drivers: Since car drivers account for the majority of casualties, focused awareness campaigns, strict monitoring, and periodic check-ups on safe driving are essential.
* Upgrade Single Carriageways: Extra safety measures should be implemented on single carriageway roads, with upgrades to dual lanes wherever feasible to reduce accident risks.
* Road Surface Improvements: Analyzing casualty trends based on road surface conditions helps identify areas needing urgent maintenance and surface upgrades for safer travel.
* Urban Area Interventions: Urban zones should be prioritized for safety interventions, particularly during daytime, to minimize road accidents in densely populated areas.
